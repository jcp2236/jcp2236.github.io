  <h2 color="#80D9FF>About:</h2>
  I'm a front end web developer interested in responsive design and UI/UX, 
  because let's face it, no one wants to use an ugly, hard to nagivate site.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "joshpullin.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
twitter_username: atx2dc
github_username:  jcp2236
